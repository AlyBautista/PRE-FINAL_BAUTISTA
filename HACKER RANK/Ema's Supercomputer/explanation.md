I created a function twoPluses(grid) that finds two largest plus shapes made of ‘G’ cells without overlapping. First, I checked every cell to see how big a plus can grow from that center. I stored each possible plus with its size, area, and covered cells. Then, I compared every pair of pluses to make sure they do not overlap and calculated the product of their areas. Finally, I returned the maximum product found.
