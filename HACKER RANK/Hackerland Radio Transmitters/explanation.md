I created a function hackerlandRadioTransmitters(x, k) to place the fewest transmitters so all houses are covered. I sorted the house positions first. Then, I moved through the list, placing each transmitter as far to the right as possible while still covering the leftmost uncovered house. After placing it, I skipped all houses that were within its range. I counted every transmitter placed and returned the total number.
