I created a function gridlandMetro(n, m, k, track) to find how many railway cells are still free. I grouped track segments by rows and sorted them to merge any overlapping intervals. For each row, I combined intervals that touched or overlapped and counted only their unique covered cells. After summing all occupied cells, I subtracted that number from the total grid area. Finally, I returned the number of unoccupied cells.
