I created a function lilysHomework(arr) to find the minimum number of swaps needed to make the array beautiful. I tried sorting the array in two ways: ascending and descending. For each version, I counted how many swaps were needed to match that order by swapping misplaced elements into their correct positions. After calculating both swap counts, I returned the smaller number as the final answer.
