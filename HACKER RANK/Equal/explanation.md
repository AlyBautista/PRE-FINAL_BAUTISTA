I created a function equal(arr) to find the minimum number of operations needed to make all values equal. I first got the smallest number in the list, then tested reducing all numbers to slightly lower values (from min to minâˆ’4). For each test, I calculated how many steps it would take using the largest reductions first (subtracting 5, then 2, then 1). I kept the smallest total operations across all tests and returned that as the final answer.
