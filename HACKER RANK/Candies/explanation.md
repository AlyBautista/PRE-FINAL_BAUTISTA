I created a function candies(n, arr) to distribute candies fairly based on ratings. First, I gave each child 1 candy. Then, I scanned from left to right and gave more candies to any child with a higher rating than the previous child. After that, I scanned from right to left and increased candies if a child had a higher rating than the next one but didnâ€™t have enough candies. Finally, I added up all the candies and returned the total.
