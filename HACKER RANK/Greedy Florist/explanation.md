I created a function getMinimumCost(k, c) to compute the lowest total cost of buying flowers. I sorted the flower prices in descending order so the expensive ones are bought first. Then, I assigned each purchase to a friend in turn, increasing the price multiplier for every flower that friend has already bought. I added all the multiplied prices to get the total cost and returned it.
