I created this functin initialize to find how many palindromic permutations can be made from parts of a string. I used modular arithmetic and BigInt for large numbers. The program builds prefix frequency arrays and precomputes factorials for quick math. For each query, it counts letter pairs and odd letters, then calculates how many palindromes can be formed. Finally, it prints the result for every query.
