I created the function powerSum to count the ways a number X can be expressed as the sum of unique natural numbers raised to the power N. I used a recursive helper function that tries every number starting from 1, subtracts its N-th power from the target, and continues searching with the next number. The recursion returns 1 when the target reaches 0 and 0 if it goes negative, summing all valid combinations.
