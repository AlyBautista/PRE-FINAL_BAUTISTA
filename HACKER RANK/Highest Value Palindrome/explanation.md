I created a function highestValuePalindrome(s, n, k) to turn a number into the largest palindrome possible with limited changes. First, I fixed mismatched pairs from both ends, using up some changes while marking which digits were modified. Then, in a second pass, I tried to upgrade digits to 9 wherever possible, using fewer changes if they were already modified. If I ran out of allowed operations, I returned -1, otherwise I returned the final palindrome string.
