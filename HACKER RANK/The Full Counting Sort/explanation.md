I created the function countSort to sort string values using counting sort based on their numeric keys. First, I determined the highest key so I could create enough buckets. Then, I placed each value into its bucket â€” but for the first half of the input, I replaced the value with a dash "-" to hide the original text. After filling all the buckets, I collected the values from each bucket in order and returned them as a single string.
