I created a function pylons(k, arr) to place the minimum number of pylons so that all areas have power. I moved through the array and each time tried to place a pylon as far to the right as possible within range k. If the position didnâ€™t allow placement, I returned -1 because powering everything was impossible. Otherwise, I counted each pylon placed and skipped ahead to the next uncovered spot. Finally, I returned the total number of pylons used.
