I created a function activityNotifications(expenditure, d) that counts how many fraud alerts should be triggered. I used a frequency array to track the spending values from the previous d days. For each new day, I calculated the median using the frequency data. If the current spending was at least twice the median, I increased the notification count. Then, I updated the frequency by removing the oldest value and adding the new one. In the end, I returned the total notifications.
