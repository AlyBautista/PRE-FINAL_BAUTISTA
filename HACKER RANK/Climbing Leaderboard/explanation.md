I created a function climbingLeaderboard(ranked, player) to track the player’s ranking after each score. First, I removed duplicate scores and sorted the leaderboard in descending order. Then, for each player score, I compared it from the end of the leaderboard and moved upward while the player’s score was high enough. Each time, I recorded the correct rank and added it to the result. Finally, I returned the list of ranks for every score the player earned.
