I wrote the function almostSorted(arr) to check if an array can be sorted by just one small operation. First, I compared the original array to a sorted copy and found all the positions where they are different. If there are no differences, the array is already sorted. If there are two differences, it means a single swap can fix it. If there are more, I tried reversing the section between the first and last mismatch. If the array becomes sorted after reversing, I return that operation. Otherwise, I return no because it canâ€™t be fixed with one swap or one reverse.
