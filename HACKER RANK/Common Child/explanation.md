I created a function commonChild(s1, s2) that finds the longest common subsequence between two strings. I used a 2D dp table to store the length of matching characters as I compared each letter of the first string with the second. If the characters matched, I increased the count; if not, I chose the larger value from the previous comparisons. At the end, I returned the value in the bottom-right corner of the table as the longest common subsequence length.
