I created a function absolutePermutation(n, k) that forms a valid permutation based on the absolute difference rule. If k = 0, I simply returned numbers from 1 to n. If the permutation is not possible (because n isnâ€™t divisible by 2k), I returned -1. Otherwise, I looped through the numbers and alternated between adding and subtracting k to create the correct pattern, and then returned the final result.
