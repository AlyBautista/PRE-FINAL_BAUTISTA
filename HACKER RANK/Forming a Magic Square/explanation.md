I created a function formingMagicSquare(s) that compares the input square to all 8 possible 3Ã—3 magic squares. For each one, I calculated the total cost by adding the absolute difference between every corresponding number. I kept track of the smallest cost found. Finally, I returned that minimum cost, which represents the least amount of change needed to make the square a magic square.
