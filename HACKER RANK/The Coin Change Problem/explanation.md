I created the function getWays to count how many different ways I can make an amount n using the coins in array c. I used a dynamic programming array called ways, where each index represents the number of ways to form that value. I set ways[0] to 1 because there is one way to make zero. Then, for each coin, I updated the number of ways to form each amount by adding ways from previous values. Finally, I returned ways[n] as the total number of possible combinations.
