I created this function called countArray to count how many valid arrays can be formed with length n, using numbers from 1 to k, and ending with the value x. I used MOD = 1e9 + 7 to keep the numbers from getting too large. I first checked if the array starts with 1. If x is equal to 1, I set endWithX to 1; otherwise, I set it to 0. Then I used a loop to update the number of arrays that end with x and those that do not. I calculated new values for both using formulas and updated them each time. After finishing the loop, I returned endWithX, which is the total number of valid arrays that end with x.
