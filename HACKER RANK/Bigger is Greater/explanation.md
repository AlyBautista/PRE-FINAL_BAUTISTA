I made a function biggerIsGreater(w) that finds the next word in alphabetical order. First, I searched from the end to find a position where a character is smaller than the one after it. If none exists, I returned "no answer" because no bigger word can be formed. Then, I found a character on the right that is just bigger and swapped them. Finally, I reversed the remaining letters after that position to make the next smallest possible order, and returned the new word.
