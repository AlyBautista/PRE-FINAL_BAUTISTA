I created this function legoBlocks to find the number of solid LEGO walls that can be built. I first calculated singleRow, which counts how many ways a row can be made using block sizes 1 to 4. Then I raised these values to the power of n to get totalWays for multiple rows. After that, I computed solid to remove unstable walls and returned solid[m], the total number of solid walls.
